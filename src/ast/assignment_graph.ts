// An assignment graph is a (mathematical or concrete) abstraction of a set of assignments that would occur in a given
// function evaluation. Unlike an AST, nodes can be shared by other nodes. Consider the following example:
// f(x) = (x+1)^2 + (x+1)
// Input: x: real
// Output: real
// $1 <- x + 1
// $2 <- $1 * $1    (or Math.pow($1, 2))
// ret <- $2 + $1
// Note how multiple lines use the node $1. In an AST, this behavior cannot happen; each node has one and exactly one
// parent. There is an important restriction, however: Each variable can only be assigned once. We have an assignment
// graph for both the mathematical and concrete stages, permitting optimizations at each level, with some degree of
// shared logic.
